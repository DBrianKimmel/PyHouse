Finding child resources.

First, the glue modules under PyHouse/src/plugins/nevow/plugins/ must be copied
to the nevow/plugin directory for the given os/distribution.  These glue modules
allow athena to find the various .css and .js files needed to operate.
Nevow uses a different mechanism to locate these files.

It is possible (thanks to Wenrner Thie) to do our own finding of resources and avoid the plugins.
This seems a lot smarter to me since it handles different platforms a lot better.



Templates.
I have chosen to use HTML instead of stan.

the xml (xhtml) file starts out with:

<html
    xmlns        = 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'
    xmlns:nevow  = 'http://nevow.com/ns/nevow/0.1'
    xmlns:athena = 'http://divmod.org/ns/athena/0.7'
    lang         = 'en'
    >
    

In order to auto load the athena JS files add:
    <head nevow:render = 'liveglue'>



To add a new element / widget:
==============================

xxxElement.html must be added to define the element / widget.

web_xxx.py must be added to handle the server side of the new widget.

xxx.js must be added to handle the client side of the widget.

web_mainpage must import the web_xxx module and provide a callback with the name (xxx) of the xxx.js file to render the element/widget.

workspace.js must add an attachWidget call to load the xxx element.
