This code creates a "One Shot' client.  The connection automatically closes after sending one message.
        l_endpoint = TCP4ClientEndpoint(p_pyhouses_obj.Reactor, p_address, AMP_PORT)
        l_defer = connectProtocol(l_endpoint, AMP())  # This creates a 'One Shot' client


This code creates a reusable client.
        l_endpoint = TCP4ClientEndpoint(p_pyhouses_obj.Reactor, p_address, AMP_PORT)
        l_defer = l_endpoint.connect(ClientFactory.forProtocol(AMP))
