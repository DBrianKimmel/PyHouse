# Network

We are stuck with IPv4 for a while I fear, so much of this will have to be IPv4 for the forseeable future.
I will try to use IPv6 where possible but I have not been able to tunnel IPv6 to all house locations.

It looks like the path to go is Netplan with systemd network management so here we go.
