# Rpi-Clone

https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone

## Install

rpi-clone is on github and is downloaded by cloning the repository.
It is a standalone script and the install is a simple copy to a bin directory.
When run it checks its program dependencies and offers to install needed packages.
But currently rpi-clone knows how to install only Debian packages with apt-get.

On a Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone.git 
cd rpi-clone
sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin
```

Make sure /usr/local/sbin is in your $PATH and then run rpi-clone or rpi-clone-setup with no args to print usage.

rpi-clone-setup is for setting the hostname in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files.
It is run automatically by rpi-clone if -s args are given, but before your first clone using a -s option,
 test run rpi-clone-setup with:

```
sudo rpi-clone-setup -t testhostname
```

And check the files under /tmp/clone-test to be sure the files have been edited correctly.
If you need additional customizations to a clone, add them to the rpi-clone-setup script.

## Usage

The examples below show a /boot partition smaller than recommended for the recent Rasbian Buster release.
rpi-clone version 2.0.21 adds the -p option so the /boot partition can be resized at the same time the root partition is resized to the end of the disk.
If you upgraded Stretch to Buster and are running with a small /boot, then for the clone to have a resized /boot, run:

```
sudo rpi-clone -f -p 256M sda
sudo rpi-clone sda
```
