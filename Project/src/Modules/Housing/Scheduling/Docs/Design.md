# Scheduling

Pyhouse maintains the series of events to be done in a house.
They include lights turning on and off, Thermostat settings, Irrigation Schedules, Pool pump on and off times and many others

## Schedule

## Sunrise / Sunset

Originally I wrote a lot of cpmplicated code to compute sunrise and sunset but then I found Astral.
I switched to astral and the code is now gone.  Hurrah!
