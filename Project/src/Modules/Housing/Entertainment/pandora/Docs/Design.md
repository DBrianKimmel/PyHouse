# Pandora

This describes the setup for playing pandora through your entertainment system.

Pandora is started by one or more nodes receiving a pandora control Mqtt message.
That message needs to contain a 'Power: On' section.

A raspberry PI is used.
It has the pianobar on the computer

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pianobar python3-venv git python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg8-dev
sudo cp /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd /etc/sudoers.d/010_pyhouse-nopasswd
sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/010_pyhouse-nopasswd
		change "pi" to "pyhouse"
sudo su pyhouse -l
python3 -m venv venv
cd venv
source bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/DBrianKimmel/PyHouse.git
pip3  install wheel
pip3  install -r PyHouse/Project/requirements.txt

sudo mkdir /var/log/pyhouse /etc/pyhouse
sudo chwon pyhouse /var/log/pyhouse /etc/pyhouse

```

Run pianobar once to get the config info.
Fill in the appropriate information in the config file an place it in the proper place on the pandora computer.

## Design

The pandora module will use pianobar to receive a stream from the pandora servers.
The computer running this may be connected to one or more A/V devices to play the music somewhere in the house.

This module receives a Mqtt control message to allow people to control the music.
Therefore it is responsible for issuing Mqtt control messages to various A/V PyHouse modules to control the sound.

This module also receives the play information from pianobar and sends a Mqtt message to allow the person
know what is going on.
entertainment/pandora/status

Pandora sometimes needs a new key.
This is generated by ????


### Control Message

The pandora module will recieve a control message and perform the action:
The computer where 'PianoBar' is installed should be the one where the pandora service is configured.
These messages have topics:
		pyhouse/house name/entertainment/pandora/control
The message payload will include "Control: xxx"
where xxx is one of:
* PowerOn
* PowerOff
* VolumeUp1
* VolumeUp5
* VolumeDown1
* VolumeDown5
* LikeYes
* LikeNo
* SkipYes

.../control msg=on will have side effects of turning on and setting the "ConnectionName" device.

### Status Message

This module issues status messages,


## XML / Configuration

** The pandora service should only be configured on computers where PianoBar is installed. **

```xml
<PandoraSection Active="True">
	<Type>Service</Type>
	<MaxSessions>1</MaxSessions>
	<Service Active="True" Key="0" Name="Pianobar running on pi-07-pp">
		<Comment>Living Room</Comment>
		<Host>192.168.1.17</Host>
		<MaxPlayTime>12345</MaxPlayTime>
		<Type>Service</Type>
		<ConnectionFamily>pioneer</ConnectionFamily>
		<ConnectionName>822-k</ConnectionName>
		<Output>Headphone</Output>
		<InputName>CD</InputName>
		<InputCode>01FN</InputCode>
		<Volume>47</Volume>
	</Service>
</PandoraSection>

```

* Host is the IP address of the computer running PyHouse and PianoBar.
* Max Sessions is the number of sessions you are allowed by your service agreement.
* Type is always Service.
* ConnectionFamily must match one of the Entertainment modules that are programmed and must be lower case.
* ConnectionName must match one of the devices in the family and also must be lower case.
* InputName is the name of the connection on the family device where the cable from the pandora computer is plugged in.
* InputCode is the code that must be sent to the family-device to cause the device to select that input channel.
* Volume is a percent of full volume to be selected when first connecting.

The following line must be placed in /etc/hosts with that is the IP address of the pandora computer.

```
192.168.1.17	pandora
```

## Now Playing

format of now-playing song = "%t" by "%a" on "%l"%r%@%s
Now playing song message format. Available format characters are:
* %t Song title
* %a Song artist
* %l Album name
* %r Rating icon (only love icon)
* %@ at_icon if station is quickmix, empty otherwise.
* %s Real station name if quickmix
* %u Song detail url

## Audio on Raspberry Pi

### Alsa

If you see this:
`ALSA lib pcm.c:2495:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.front`

Edit the file: `/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`
change the line “pcm.front cards.pcm.front” to “pcm.front cards.pcm.default”

### END DBK
