<p>PyHouse is a home automation tool.</p>

<p>It is written to become a daemon on a Linux computer.</p>

<p>It is now (2013-06-06) running in a raspberry pi model B.  It has been turning
lights on and off reliably for several weeks on this new platform.</p>

<p>See <strong>init</strong> module for developer documentation.</p>

<h2>
<a name="lighting" class="anchor" href="#lighting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lighting</h2>

<p>One of the first of the components is a Lighting system.
The goal of this component is to automate the daily lighting system.
There is a schedule associated with the lighting system and its purpose
is to turn lights on and off at various times of the day and night.</p>

<p>The system was developed around the Insteon lighting controls.  There is also
the beginnings of a UPB system included along with X-10 beginnings.  Some of
the controllers used for development are serial connections with the computer
while the newer controllers are USB connections.</p>

<h2>
<a name="hvac" class="anchor" href="#hvac"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HVAC</h2>

<p>The HVAC system is being added to allow the schedule of the lighting system
to control the house's heating and air conditioning.</p>

<h2>
<a name="upnp" class="anchor" href="#upnp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UPnP</h2>

<p>UPnP is being developed and added as a separate control mechanism for the
lighting system as well as entertainment</p>

<h2>
<a name="entertainment" class="anchor" href="#entertainment"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Entertainment</h2>

<p>The entertainment component is to allow the control of the house TV, Radio
and other similar devices via UPnP.</p>

<h2>
<a name="communication" class="anchor" href="#communication"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Communication</h2>

<p>The communication component will include telephone, cell phone, fax, email etc.</p>
