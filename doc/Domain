The PyHouse Domain is simply called Domain in this project except where it may be confusing which domain is under discussion.

The domain is a 64 bit number expressed the same way as an IPv6 address is expressed.
All nodes in the domain freely exchange information and cooperate in the PyHouse automation Island.
