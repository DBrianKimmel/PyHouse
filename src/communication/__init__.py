"""I now live in two different houses, one for a little more than 6 or 7 months a year and in the other house 5 to 6 months each year.
Why hould we have to give out several phone numbers and the people calling us have to guess which number to call?
So this communication module was born.

Cell phones changed the way we communicate and I believe that our communications will continue to change as we grow more technological.

I am not going to wait for the established utility companies give us new 'stuff'; it is time to invent it on our own.

I expect this module to change completely, several times even, as we invent different paradigms for communication.

Modules planned:
  Telephone - Primarily land line.
  Cellular - Cell Phones
  Fax - Getting obsolete methinks.
  Email - Home collection of various email accounts.

Perhaps these should go in here or perhaps in entertainment:
  Books - Collections of e-books for various family members
  Videos
  Music
  Photos
