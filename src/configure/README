This package is required for PyHouse.

It will use XML to read/store the configuration.

Major subsections will have an active flag set to true if they are used.
If a section is not used it will be preserved and the active flag will be
 set to false.

Example of XML file

<PyHouse>
    <Houses Active=true>
        <House Name=name Key=1 Active=true>
            <Location>
                ,,,
            </location>
            <Rooms>
                <Room Name=name Key=1 Active=true>
                    ...
                </Room>
